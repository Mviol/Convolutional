# Convolutional
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a specialized class of deep neural network architectures designed to process grid data such as images and videos. These networks are especially effective in computer vision tasks because they incorporate convolution layers, which are responsible for extracting local and spatial patterns in the inputs.
